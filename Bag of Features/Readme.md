This project is about implementing "bag of features" method for object recognition.
SIFT is used for feature extraction from images.
PCA is used for dimensionality reduction.
k-means algorithm is used to obtain the visual keywords.
k-NN classifier is used to classify 5 different categories of objects.

The results of the classification and confusion matrices can be found in the .pdf file report.
